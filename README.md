# Base React Application [Boilerplate]

A React application set up conveniently from scratch with <strong>TypeScript</strong>

Hello everyone,

This repository is a boilerplate that can be used for bootstrapping web applications using the React JavaScript library.

<strong>I had previously done the same for standard JavaScript but this time it was set up using TypeScript</strong>.

I am aware that there are easier ways of doing it using convenient tools like `create-react-app` but I like doing things from the ground up in essence. I went through lots of resources and set up a boilerplate which is configured with:

* <strong>TypeScript</strong>
* <strong>Webpack 5</strong>
* <strong>Babel 7</strong>
* <strong>Redux</strong>
* <strong>Support for SASS/SCSS stylesheets</strong>
* <strong>Basic React project configurations</strong>
* <strong>Redux-Saga Middlware</strong>
* <strong>React Router</strong>

The project structure is left as simple as it could be so you can move things around to your convenience. Happy coding :)
